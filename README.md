# Codechef_February_Long_Challenge
Question-1:You are given an integer N. Find the largest integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive) which divides N.

Input
The first and only line of the input contains a single integer N.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the largest divisor of N between 1 and 10.

Constraints
2≤N≤1,000
Subtasks

Example Input 1
24
Example Output 1
8
Explanation
The divisors of 24 are 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24, out of which 1,2,3,4,6,8 are in the range [1,10]. Therefore, the answer is max(1,2,3,4,6,8)=8.

Example Input 2
91
Example Output 2
7
Explanation
The divisors of 91 are 1,7,13,91, out of which only 1 and 7 are in the range [1,10]. Therefore, the answer is max(1,7)=7.

Question-2:You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,AN. Find the maximum value of the expression |Ax−Ay|+|Ay−Az|+|Az−Ax| over all triples of pairwise distinct valid indices (x,y,z).

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum value of |Ax−Ay|+|Ay−Az|+|Az−Ax|.

Constraints
1≤T≤5
3≤N≤105
|Ai|≤109 for each valid i

2 2 2 2 5
Example Output
10

6
Explanation
Example case 1: The value of the expression is always 10. For example, let x=1, y=2 and z=3, then it is |2−7|+|7−5|+|5−2|=5+2+3=10.

Example case 2: Since all values in the sequence are the same, the value of the expression is always 0.

Example case 3: One optimal solution is x=1, y=2 and z=5, which gives |2−2|+|2−5|+|5−2|=0+3+3=6.

Question-3: A time is a string in the format "HH:MM AM" or "HH:MM PM" (without quotes), where HH and MM are always two-digit numbers. A day starts at 12:00 AM and ends at 11:59 PM. You may refer here for understanding the 12-hour clock format.

Chef has scheduled a meeting with his friends at a time P. He has N friends (numbered 1 through N); for each valid i, the i-th friend is available from a time Li to a time Ri (both inclusive). For each friend, can you help Chef find out if this friend will be able to attend the meeting? More formally, check if Li≤P≤Ri for each valid i.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single time P.
The second line contains a single integer N.
N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated times Li and Ri.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one string with length N. For each valid i, the i-th character of this string should be '1' if i-th friend will be able to attend the meeting or '0' otherwise.

Constraints
1≤T≤500
1≤N≤500
each time is valid in the 12-hour clock format
for each valid i, the time Ri is greater or equal to Li

12:00 PM 11:59 PM
Example Output
1100
11101
Explanation
Example case 1:

Friend 1: 12:01 AM lies between 12:00 AM and 11:42 PM (that is, between 00:00 and 23:42 in the 24-hour clock format), so this friend will be able to attend the meeting.
Friend 2: 12:01 AM lies between 12:01 AM and 11:59 AM (between 00:01 and 11:59 in the 24-hour clock format).
Friend 3: 12:01 AM does not lie between 12:30 AM and 12:30 PM (between 00:30 and 12:30 in the 24-hour clock format), so this friend will not be able to attend the meeting.
Friend 4: 12:01 AM does not lie between 11:59 AM and 11:59 PM (between 11:59 and 23:59 in the 24-hour clock format).
Example case 2: For friend 3, 04:12 PM lies between 04:12 PM and 04:12 PM (inclusive) and hence this friend will be able to attend the meeting.
